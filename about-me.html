				<p>
					A committed individual who is keen on making a positive impact on both the people around him and the projects he works on. Pratik’s consistent enthusiasm and drive have demonstrated a desire to go above and beyond what’s asked of him. He is always the one to ask the first question and possesses an impressive ability to retain a large amount of information. Outside of training he has been focusing his attention on design and development with a particular interest in layout and usability. His easy-going nature and humorous tendencies make him a lovable addition to the training room and a valuable asset to the workplace.
